Elixir wrapper for the [Fantasy Football Nerd API](http://www.fantasyfootballnerd.com/fantasy-football-api)

## Features

Nothing to see here, yet. :)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add ffn_api to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:ffn_api, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure ffn_api is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:ffn_api]]
        end
